New to Online Dating? Five Things That Will Help You!

The Internet has made a lot of things possible, such as online dating. The problem is that many people still aren’t sure how to go out dating online. There are still a lot of people out there who grew up without the Internet, with social skills that revolve around actually seeing the other person in real life. With so much information readily available online through status messages and profile pages, it can be difficult to figure out just where to start.

1. Focus on Making a Positive First Impression The first impression of you he or she gets will color all your interactions, especially if you’re going to start with chat or text messages. A good first impression can make your comments funny and flirty, while a bad one can result in a restraining order. Managing your first impression is a matter of finding out where they’re going to make first contact. First contact is likely to be achieved through your profile page, and even if it isn’t, they’re going to look at it at some point. Pick the right picture and write a one-sentence description that can give them a good idea what to expect from you. Make sure that your right picture is accurate and up-to-date. Putting up an older picture ten pounds ago might get you more attention, but it probably won’t lead anywhere. Make no mistake – at some point, they’re going to meet with you in person. That’s the point of online dating – to transition from virtual meet-ups to real-life dates.

2. Be Personable Some people are introverts and there’s nothing wrong with that. Announcing that you are an introvert and not really looking for someone on a dating website, however, sounds insane. You’re clearly looking for someone and while you’re still an introvert at heart, on that site you need to show people that you’re making an effort to connect with interested parties. You don’t have to change who you are, but you do have to consider that people aren’t going to be looking at your profile in context. All they’ll know about you is what you put on the page, and that means being clear. Getting clever and trying to be funny with some self-deprecation will likely result in making you look like you have self-esteem issues rather than getting a laugh. Again, you don’t need to lie about who you are on your page. Any lies will likely come back to haunt you if a connection transitions into a real-life date. You do, however, have to actually live up to the “dating” part of “online dating.” You’re trying to meet new people. There’s no reason to be ashamed of that fact and every reason to present the idea that you are looking to meet someone nice.

This should get you prepared for your foray into the world of online dating. It’s a difficult and constantly changing world, but that’s part of the fun. Embrace it, have fun, and good luck!
